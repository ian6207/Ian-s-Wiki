        Do you know who Kabosu is? You may not be familiar with the name but you've probably seen her on the internet. She has big eyes and a wide smirk, that was hilarious enough to become one of the most famous memes! She was born on November 2, 2005. Then soon was adopted by Atsuko Sato, a Japanese kindergarden teacher in Japan, at 2008. Atsuko Sato posted images of her dog. Soon in July 2013 the image was starting to get popular. Then the image was called Doge. At 2024, Kabosu got seriously ill. She died as if she was asleep. Kabosu lived a happy life. And always will be remembered as the Doge.
