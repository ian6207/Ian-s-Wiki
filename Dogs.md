        Dogs have the nickname; "The Man's Best Friend" It's because it is made the main pet of the man. To get a dog, you need to have multiple things ready: a bed, food, water, and a leash. You need to walk and take your dog outside at least four times a day. If you don't want your dog to use the bathroom in your house, you should either train it, give it lot's of walks, or give it a bathroom pad. Some dogs have special needs. If your up for a special needs adoptions, I recomend Frosted Faces Co. that's all over America!
